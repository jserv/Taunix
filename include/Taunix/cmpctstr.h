/* In TI DSP, its basic memory unit is WORD, 2 bytes.
   And it's the same with char type data. Therefore
   it will waste space if your data type is based on 
   1-byte basis. So one can use cmpctstr/xpndstr to 
   compact/expand strings.
   
   The following figures are what they do:
   
   cmpctstr:
   
                Brfore call      After call
char *string   +-----+-----+    +-----+-----+
